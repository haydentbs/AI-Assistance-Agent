# Prompt Engineering Knowledge Base

## Core Principles of Effective Prompts

### Clarity and Specificity
- Be explicit about the desired output format, tone, and content
- Provide clear constraints and boundaries
- Specify the role the AI should adopt (e.g., "Act as a financial advisor")

### Context Provision
- Include relevant background information
- Define key terms if domain-specific knowledge is required
- Provide examples when possible to guide the model

### Structured Formatting
- Use numbered lists for sequential instructions
- Employ bullet points for parallel options
- Utilize markdown formatting to emphasize important elements

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Guide the model to "think step by step" for complex reasoning
- Break down multi-step problems explicitly
- Ask the model to explain its reasoning process

### Few-Shot Learning
- Provide 2-3 examples of desired input-output pairs
- Ensure examples cover different cases or edge conditions
- Maintain consistent formatting across examples

### Role-Based Prompting
- Assign specific personas to the AI (e.g., "You are an expert physicist")
- Define the relationship between the AI and user (e.g., mentor/student)
- Set appropriate expertise levels based on the target audience

## Common Pitfalls

### Ambiguity
- Vague instructions lead to unpredictable outputs
- Undefined terms create room for misinterpretation
- Conflicting directives cause confusion

### Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities
- Be cautious about allowing unfiltered user input in prompts
- Implement guardrails against instruction overrides
- Use separate prompts for system instructions and user content

### Hallucination Triggers
- Avoid asking for information beyond the model's knowledge cutoff
- Be cautious with prompts requesting highly specific facts
- Implement fact-checking mechanisms for critical information

## Optimization Strategies

### Iterative Refinement
- Start with a basic prompt and incrementally improve
- Test variations to identify which elements improve performance
- Document successful patterns for reuse

### Temperature and Sampling Controls
- Lower temperature (0.1-0.4) for factual, deterministic responses
- Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) for creative applications
- Consider using top_p sampling for controlled creativity

### Prompt Templates
- Create reusable templates for common use cases
- Include placeholders for variable content
- Document the purpose and limitations of each template
