# AI Risk Management Knowledge Base

## Risk Categories in AI Systems

### Technical Risks
- **Model Drift**: Performance degradation over time as data patterns change
- **Robustness Issues**: Vulnerability to adversarial attacks or edge cases
- **Scalability Challenges**: System performance under increased load
- **Integration Failures**: Compatibility issues with existing systems

### Ethical Risks
- **Bias and Fairness**: Discriminatory outcomes across demographic groups
- **Transparency Issues**: "Black box" decision-making without explanations
- **Privacy Concerns**: Improper handling of sensitive personal data
- **Autonomy Infringement**: Systems that limit human agency or choice

### Operational Risks
- **Dependency Risks**: Over-reliance on AI for critical functions
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Insufficient oversight of deployed systems
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Difficulty in updating or fixing issues
- **Resource Consumption**: Unexpected computational or energy requirements

### Compliance Risks
- **Regulatory Violations**: Non-compliance with AI-specific regulations
- **Liability Issues**: Unclear responsibility for AI-caused harm
- **Documentation Deficiencies**: Inadequate records of development decisions
- **Intellectual Property Concerns**: Unclear ownership of AI-generated content

## Risk Assessment Frameworks

### Quantitative Assessment
- Risk Impact Ã— Probability matrices
- Expected value calculations for risk scenarios
- Benchmarking against industry standards
- Stress testing under various conditions

### Qualitative Assessment
- Expert judgment and stakeholder consultations
- Scenario planning and red-teaming exercises
- Ethics reviews and value alignment checks
- User experience testing with diverse populations

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Controls
- Robust testing regimes (unit, integration, adversarial)
- Continuous monitoring and alerting systems
- Graceful degradation mechanisms
- Redundancy and fallback systems

### Governance Controls
- Clear accountability structures
- Decision review processes
- Documentation requirements
- Regular risk reassessment cycles

### Operational Controls
- Staff training and awareness programs
- Incident response procedures
- Change management protocols
- Regular audits and compliance checks

## Implementation Guidance

### Risk Management Lifecycle
1. **Identification**: Systematic discovery of potential risks
2. **Assessment**: Evaluation of likelihood and impact
3. **Prioritization**: Focus on highest-risk areas first
4. **Mitigation**: Implementation of controls
5. **Monitoring**: Ongoing surveillance and measurement
6. **Review**: Regular reassessment and adjustment

### Documentation Best Practices
- Maintain a risk register with clear ownership
- Document all mitigation decisions and their rationale
- Create audit trails for high-risk system changes
- Develop clear incident response playbooks

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Involve diverse perspectives in risk identification
- Communicate risks clearly to decision-makers
- Engage end-users in risk assessment processes
- Maintain transparency with oversight bodies

## Emerging Standards and Regulations

### Key Frameworks
- EU AI Act requirements and risk classifications
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- ISO/IEC standards for AI systems
- Industry-specific guidelines (healthcare, finance, etc.)

### Compliance Approaches
- Documentation requirements for high-risk systems
- Conformity assessments and third-party audits
- Ongoing monitoring obligations
- Incident reporting requirements
